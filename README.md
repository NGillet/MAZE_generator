# MAZE_generator
 a Maze generator with Q-Learning

# Usage

## Examples

# Algorythm
This section will describ the algorythm choises made. 

## Specifications 
The specifications impose the use the Q-learning algorythm to generate a doable maze.

But the specifications do not defined what is a 'do-able Maze' : 
- is a grid with no wall a 'do-able Maze'?
- is a grid with only one wall a 'do-able Maze'?

I assume that a 'do-able **nice** Maze' is : 
- any doable grid
- a grid with a minimum of walls, but not too much (one way maze...). So maximize the number of walls up to half the total number of wall possible seems a good esthetical compromise.

## Maze management

Three main fonctions associated to the maze are needed by the generator : 
- Define the START, EXIT and CHEST cells
- Build Walls
- Check if the maze is doable

To construct those functions, I describe the grid of the maze as a tree of linked cells

### The tree

The grid is composed of cells, cells have neighbors, the transition between cells is a wall, the wall can be build (up, true...) or not (down, false...).

*Fig 1 : on the left : a 4x4 grid with cells and walls IDs. On the right : the tree associate to the grid. NOTE : the shape of the tree change with the START cell.*

The tree is compose of layers, each layer is a list of cells. The tree is build recursivelly from the first layer, which contain only the starting cell. Then each layer is build from the neighbors cells of the previous layer, **for cells 
that are not already in the tree** (to avoid infinit loop). Each cell store the next cells and its previous cells. 

The tree structure permits to 'build wall' by removing a cell in the 'next' and 'previous' list. By going from cell to 'next' and 'previous' it is possible to check if the EXIT and CHEST cells are connected to the start cell. 



## Q-learning management

This section is not maint to explain the Q-learning algorythm, but to explain the choise made. 
The three main parameters to setup are the actions possible of the agent, the states of the grid and rewards.

### Actions
The actions are 'build one of wall' and 'stop building' (the maze is done). Therefore the number of action is equal to number of wall plus one.

### States
The states are the current number of walls on the grid. Therefore the number of wall is also equal to number of wall plus one (from 0 wall to all wall build).

### Rewards
I defined three rewards : 
1. Reward for finishing a doable maze : it encourage the agent to stop building wall while the maze is doable
2. Reward for building walls : it encourage the agent to build walls
3. Penality for building a wall that brake the maze

The rewards (1) and (2) are adversarial, by adjusting the value of the reward we could build **nice doable maze**. 

### Hyper-parameters
There are other parameters that have to defined : 
- learning rate : 
- discount : 
- exploration/exploitation exponential decay : 

# Architecture
 The code is based on 2 main class : 
 - One to manage the maze's grid and walls : Tree.py
 - One to manage the Q-learning : Agent.py

## Tree.py
Contain 2 class : 
- `class Cell:` represent a cell of the grid, it contain its position (1D and 2D) and the list of neighbors, next and previous cells. Note that the next and previous list are only defined and usefull in the tree structure.
- `class Cell_Tree:` represent the grid : 
    - it create the special cells : START, EXIT and CHEST
    - it generate the tree recursivelly
    - it has function to build or brake walls
    - it has function to check if the maze is doable

## Agent.py
Contain one class :
- `class Agent(tree):` it take a tree in input, and permit to manage the agent for the Q-learning and generate a maze. It has two main functions :
    - `def train():` train the agent to build a **nice doable maze**
    - `def generate():` generate the maze from the Q-value matrix (after training)
